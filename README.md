# PasswordGenerator
super quick and dirty password generator

This genorator was a quick project just to have readily avaliable, easily human readible, passwords for new users.
I based it off of Metal Gear Solid 5's soldier naming system, so the password is AdjectiveNoun format.

The script uses random.choice() to pick a random adjective (from an array), noun (also from an array), and number (0,9), and special character and concatenates them 
to create a password.
